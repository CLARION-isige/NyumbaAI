House hunting can be very hectic  especially moving into unknown city or county coming from a personal standpoint.

This project aims to address this by, having potential tenants/home buyers search for houses in the areas of their liking, see the price range and get conttact information for further inquiry. 
The user also gets to see the map to the location of the houses and the website if it exists. 

This aims to reduce the time people take to search for houses and ensuring a seamless experience with minimal effort.
